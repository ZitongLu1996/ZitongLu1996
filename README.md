### I'm Zitong Lu :cn: !

- :wink::mortar_board: I'm now a master student in cognitive neuroscience from East China Normal University (Shanghai, China).
     Before that, I received a BEng degree in software engineering from Northeastern University (Shenyang, China).
- :eyes::key: Iâ€™m currently working on visual working memory by using EEG, fMRI and computational models.
- :sweat_smile::high_brightness: Iâ€™m the author of [NeuroRA](https:/zitonglu1996.github.io/NeuroRA/) - A Python toolbox of representational analysis from multimode neural data.
- :e-mail::mailbox_with_mail: If you have any question about my projects, you can email me: [zitonglu1996@gmail.com](zitonglu1996@gmail.com) / [zitonglu@outlook.com](zitonglu@outlook.com)
- :smiley::bulb: Research Interests: Visual working memory, Attention, Decision Making, Machine Learning & Deep Learning.
- :dizzy_face::telescope: Future goals: :one: Explore how brain encoding memory (especially basic visual features) and making decision. :two: Explore the connections between biological vision & memory and AI models. :three: Using neuroscience methhods to improve cognitive ability.

### Notes - Finding a cooperator!
- Are you interesting in implementing a Toolbox for neuroscientists and psychologists?
- PyCTRSA will be a simple but helpful Python toolkit for cross-temporal RSA-based decoding for EEG and MEG data.
- This work would be affilliated with [NeuroRA](https:/zitonglu1996.github.io/NeuroRA/), but it is an independent part.
- If you are familiar with PyPlot or any other Python Plotting package and interested in writing documents with me, you can contact me!
- The algorithms in PyCTRSA would be realized by me in several weeks. Hope we can work together and finish this simple project in 1-2 month(s) and maybe we can write an article to submit the journal of open source software (JOSS) at the end!
- If you are interested in this, please email me ([zitonglu1996@gmail.com](zitonglu1996@gmail.com)) with your CV and we can discuss the prossibilities!
